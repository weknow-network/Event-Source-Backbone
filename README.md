# Event-Source-Backbone 

## Understanding Event Sourcing
Event sourcing is an architectural pattern that captures and persists every change as a sequence of events. It provides a historical log of events that can be used to reconstruct the current state of an application at any given point in time. This approach offers various benefits, such as auditability, scalability, and the ability to build complex workflows.

Event sourcing, when combined with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, offers even more advantages. CQRS separates the read and write concerns of an application, enabling the generation of dedicated databases optimized for specific read or write needs. This separation of concerns allows for more agile and flexible database schema designs, as they are less critical to set up in advance.

By leveraging EventSource.Backbone, developers can implement event sourcing and CQRS together, resulting in a powerful architecture that promotes scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

## Introducing EventSource.Backbone
One notable aspect of EventSource.Backbone is its unique approach to event sourcing. Instead of inventing a new event source database, EventSource.Backbone leverages a combination of existing message streams like Kafka, Redis Stream, or similar technologies, along with key-value databases or services like Redis.

This architecture enables several benefits. Message streams, while excellent for handling event sequences and ensuring reliable message delivery, may not be optimal for heavy payloads. By combining key-value databases with message streams, EventSource.Backbone allows the message payload to be stored in the key-value database while the stream holds the sequence and metadata. This approach improves performance and facilitates compliance with GDPR standards by allowing the splitting of messages into different keys based on a standardized key format.

It's worth noting that EventSource.Backbone currently provides a software development kit (SDK) for the .NET ecosystem. While the framework may expand to other programming languages and frameworks in the future, at present, it is specifically focused on the .NET platform.

## Leveraging Existing Infrastructure
One of the major advantages of EventSource.Backbone is its compatibility with widely adopted message streaming platforms like Kafka or Redis Stream. These platforms provide robust message delivery guarantees and high throughput, making them ideal for handling event streams at scale.

Furthermore, EventSource.Backbone seamlessly integrates with popular key-value databases such as Redis, Couchbase, or Amazon DynamoDB. This integration allows developers to leverage the strengths of these databases for efficient storage and retrieval of auxiliary data related to events.

## Conclusion
In this introductory post, we've explored the concept of event sourcing and introduced the unique aspects of EventSource.Backbone. This framework stands out by leveraging a combination of message streams and key-value databases to achieve better performance, support GDPR standards, and provide flexibility in event sourcing implementations.

EventSource.Backbone integrates seamlessly with popular message streaming platforms and key-value databases, enabling developers to leverage their strengths for scalable and efficient event sourcing.

When combined with CQRS, event sourcing can enhance database schema design, making it more agile and flexible, and enabling the generation of dedicated databases optimized for specific needs.
